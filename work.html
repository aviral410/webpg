	<p class="body">Well, I am new at at coding so I have not made many repositories, but still I have made 4 repositories at Github. You can can look those, they might proove useful to you, moreover my every new repository is better than before, it can be better in any of the the parameters, so I would suggest you to lways look the latest repository as I am still learning and will try to improve some or the other thing in every webpage. We can add many effects over HTML by using CSS, but that only works if you have enough knowlegde of HTML and CSS. Comparitively HTML is easier than CSS as in HTML only the written portion is required. We can reduce the written portion in CSS by using some smarts tricks, for say, by giving the same class for the title and the body respectively. Further, I would only say "Practise makes a man Perfect" the more you practise the better code you will write.</p> <br><br>
